# Space-Blaster

This is a multiplayer (split screen) game that I created using the pygame() library in Python. There are namely two players, BLUE & RED, and there are BLUE & RED spaceships that shoot meteor falling randomly from the top of the screen and 1pt is awarded for each meteor shot. The player with the most points in 60 seconds.
